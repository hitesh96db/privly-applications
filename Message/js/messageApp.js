/**
 * @fileOverview This file provides the model layer of Message
 * App. Message App is a simple Privly application that supports
 * text encryption.
 *
 * Fore more details about the Message App, please visit Privly
 * website.
 *
 * About the MVC architecture of the Privly application:
 * 
 *   An interactive Privly application can be splitted into
 *   three parts: Model, View, Controller.
 *
 *   First of all, let's determine different use cases of a
 *   Privly app. Generally, a Privly app has three use cases:
 *   
 *   1) show
 *      When the link is embedded into a host page, this
 *      application will be embedded to the host page to present
 *      the content of the link. This is the `show` case.
 *      
 *   2) new
 *      When user clicks `new` button in a browser action button,
 *      or in a context menu, or in the Privly navigation bar, this
 *      application will be shown to user, allowing user to create
 *      such kind of content. In this case, it is `new`.
 *      About editing an existing content, it should be categorized
 *      to `new` case. However due to historical issue (?), it is
 *      now charged by the `show` case.
 *
 *   3) seamless
 *      We introduced a new method of creating content: seamless-
 *      posting. For `new` case, the users are creating content in
 *      a saparated, standalone window, and the content is created
 *      when users click 'Save' button. However in `seamless` case,
 *      the users are creating content seamlessly in the host page.
 *      Besides, the content is created once users enter `seamless`
 *      mode, and will be frequently updated or finally deleted.
 *      In short, in `seamless` case, the user is going to create
 *      the content using the Privly App, just inside the host page.
 *
 *   Now let's see what are the MVC of a Privly application.
 *
 *   VIEW LAYER
 *   ==========
 * 
 *   The view layer is the user interface layer. Currently we have
 *   three view prototypes: show, new and seamless. Yes as you can
 *   see, these three view prototypes provide templates for the 
 *   three use cases. We offer templates for App developers, to
 *   allow faster App development. However those templates are
 *   free to be inherited, extended or overridden so it is still
 *   flexable. For example, our `show` view prototype provides a
 *   textarea for users to input contents. However you can override
 *   that part of the template to allow users dragging image into
 *   it.
 *
 *   Notice that, if your App supports `seamless` view, it should
 *   also provides a `seamless_ttlselect` view, used to display
 *   seconds_until_burn menu for user. If you don't want to change
 *   menu styles, or change menu orders, using our default
 *   prototype is enough for your App.
 *
 * 
 *   MODEL LAYER
 *   ===========
 *   
 *   The model layer handles such basic tasks below:
 *   
 *   - How should the user inputted content in the view layer be
 *     transformed into a Privly structured_content? This task is
 *     used in publishing or editing the content.
 *
 *     Example:
 *     For Plainpost App, no transformations.
 *     For Message App, the transformation is encryption.
 *     For Image App (not existed yet), the transformation is
 *     binary serialization and encryption.
 *     
 *   - How should we transform a Privly structured_content to the
 *     content that the view layer can present? This task is just
 *     a reserve situation of the task above. It is used when user
 *     is going to see the content (`show` case).
 *
 *     For example, for Message App, the transformation is decryption
 *     according to the encryption key attached in the link.
 *
 *   - What are the `seconds_until_burn` options for this App? An
 *     app can assign its own seconds_until_burn (aka. TTL, Time
 *     To Live) option items.
 *
 *   Notice that the model part can provide other interfaces as well.
 *   Generally those interfaces are useful in the controller layer.
 *
 *   Also please notice that, generally all interfaces of the model
 *   layer should be async, by returning a Promise which will later
 *   be resolved. The async feature of a model doesn't have much
 *   effect in current Privly Application like Message and Plainpost,
 *   however it does offer developers more flexibility.
 *   
 * 
 *   CONTROLLER LAYER
 *   ================
 *
 *   Controller layer connects model layer and view layer. It can
 *   offer extra actions for every view layer events, for example,
 *   for a Message App, when a new link is created, we have to concat
 *   the encryption key after the link. Another example is, when
 *   we are presenting the content of a Message App, we should do a
 *   Markdown rendering. This task should also be completed by the
 *   controller layer.
 *
 *   In the Privly application, you needn't explicitly connects
 *   all interface between view and model. You can just pass the
 *   model to the view! The view will call related interface
 *   itself. For a controller, you only need to write initializing
 *   code and write event handlers if you want to change the
 *   default process of a prototype view.
 *   
 * For Message App, the controller layer for each view is:
 *   new:       Message/js/new.js
 *   show:      Message/js/show.js
 *   seamless:  Markdown/js/seamless.js
 *   seamless_ttl: Markdown/js/seamless_ttl.js
